## Get Started

### Introduction

**Welcome to the EmailBison Docs**

This documentation aims to get you started on using the robust EmailBison API. This documentation is not meant as a replacement to the API Reference, rather, it aims to supplement it. It will go over common workflows, and show the API calls to achieve them.

## Using this documentation

This documentation is separated into categories, which have pages on common workflows when using EmailBison. Pages will have subsections, which can easily be navigated to from the navigation menu on the right side of each page. Keep an eye out for tabs that are on many pages, they will provide alternate workflows, text and video versions, as well as API and UI versions.

### Show Tabs Example

If you are less familiar with APIs, need a refresher, or there are some terms used in this documentation that need explaining, visit [Quickstart](#).

If you are mainly interacting with the EmailBison APIs through a low-code tool, such as Clay, Zapier, or Make, visit [Low-Code Tools](#) to supplement the API calls found throughout this documentation.
