# Quickstart

## Making API Requests

It is recommended to familiarize yourself with making one-off requests to the API to test the endpoints and their responses.

EmailBison provides you with an API reference page that allows you to test any of the available endpoints by clicking the `Test Request` button. You can access this page by navigating to `Settings` -> `Developer API` -> `Full API Reference`.

Alternatively, you can use tools such as Postman to make these requests, as you can import the curl requests from the examples provided throughout these docs.
