# Leads

## Overview

Leads, also referred to as Contacts, are your potential email addresses being contacted as part of campaigns.

EmailBison provides unlimited storage for leads. However, CSVs and campaigns are limited to 50,000 leads at once.

## Updating Leads

Leads can be updated by uploading the same CSV with new values, provided the email address doesn't change.

This will also update them in-place in any campaigns they are in, without any further input from the user.

---

## Custom Variables

Custom Variables exist separately from leads, as just names, and each lead can have a value associated with any custom variable on a workspace.

They are unique to each workspace, and must be created in advance.

For example, you create the custom variable `linkedin_url` on a workspace. Each lead you upload in that workspace, you can attach any value for `linkedin_url`.

## ESP Tagging

Every lead uploaded to EmailBison will automatically be tagged with their ESP, to give you the choice of ESP Matching.

## Workspace Interactions

You can have the same lead (email address) in multiple workspaces. However, each lead will be unique, with a different ID. This essentially means that the same email address could have all the other fields (such as name, title, custom variables) be different in each workspace.
